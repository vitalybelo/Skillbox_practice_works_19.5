Wonders of the World

Humans are generally good at noticing beautiful things.
Humans are also generally good at building beautiful things.
A Wonder of the World is a landmark1 or a natural phenomenon
that is significant2 enough to be noticed by any person around
the world. Many different lists of the Wonders of the World
were made over the course of history, so lets have a look at some!

The first of such lists was made by a Greek historian Herodotus.
Only three places were mentioned in it. Eventually the list was
expanded up to seven Wonders. Probably everyone can name at least
some of those monuments: the Great Pyramid of Giza; the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon; the Lighthouse of Alexandria; the Colossus
of Rhodes; the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus; the Temple of Artemis;
the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The curious thing about these Wonders
is that almost all of them represent3 the Greek culture. Another thing
to note is that the ancient Greeks have not actually used the term wonder,
but instead it was a list of things to see, making such lists essentially4
just a travel guide. Almost all of these Wonders were destroyed one way or another,
and today only the Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Cheops
or the Pyramid of Khufu, still stands.

This was not the only list of supposed Wonders though.
Later on, many attempts were made (with a little to no consensus) to either
make a new list or add more Wonders to the existing one. The most remarkable
candidates were Colosseum of Rome, Hagia Sophia of Istanbul, Taj Mahal and
the Great Wall of China.

Another peculiar5 attempt was made in 1994. The American Society of Civil
Engineers made a list of Seven Wonders of Modern World, focusing mainly on
an engineering scope of selected projects. Among other projects, this list
features Panama Canal, Channel Tunnel and CN Tower of Toronto, which was
the tallest structure in the world up to 2007.

There is also a list of Natural Wonders of the World. It included the Great
Barrier Reef, Mount Everest, the Grand Canyon of Arizona and, curiously enough,
aurora, making it the first list of its kind to include a phenomenon instead of a place.

But what about the world beyond Earth? Surely, it must have its wonders too!
And indeed, in 1999, an attempt was made to list Seven Wonders of the Solar System.
Amongst those were the rings of Saturn, the asteroid belt and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.

Ultimately, the world is too big of a place to make an exhaustive list of all
landmarks worth visiting. But those that did not make into any prominent list are
still protected and treasured by their neighbours. The organization that manages
the lists of such landmarks and attends7 to any legal matters regarding them is called UNESCO.
